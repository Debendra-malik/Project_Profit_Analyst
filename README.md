# Project_Profit_Analyst
This project focuses on analyzing company profit and loss data.  I used Excel and SQL to clean, filter, and organize the data.  Profit trends were analyzed by product, region, and time period.  The analysis helped identify high-profit and low-profit areas.  Insights from this project support better business decision-making.
